Hello, I’m Nick Garcia, an undergraduate molecular biology and genetics student at the University of Toronto.

I’m interested in botanical genomics, pathology, and biotechnology as they relate to agriculture. Software development just so happens to be really fun.

I can be reached at nick.garcia@mail.utoronto.ca.
